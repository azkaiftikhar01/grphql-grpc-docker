# gRPC & GraphQL with Docker

This repository is created to practice and experiment with:
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.
- **Docker**: A platform to containerize applications and manage dependencies efficiently.

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of Docker and how to containerize Node.js applications.
- Implement and explore gRPC and GraphQL services.
- Practice deploying and running these services in Docker containers.

## Features
- Example gRPC service setup.
- Example GraphQL service setup.
- Dockerfile and Docker Compose for containerization.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azkaiftikhar01/grphql-grpc-docker.git
   cd grphql-grpc-docker
